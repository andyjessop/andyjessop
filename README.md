### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [a front-end framework](https://github.com/andyjessop/pivot) that encourages long-lived, decoupled code for SPAs.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently starting to write down thoughts, ideas, and experiences. You can find them on my DEV.to page [here](https://dev.to/andyjessop).
- ğŸ‘¯ I'm interested in tooling, infrastructure, productivity, and of course...AI.
- ğŸ’¬ Get in touch if you want to discuss any of my projects or interests.
