### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy Jessop, a passionate software engineer, focussing on front-end development.

I _love_ quality, and _loathe_ the throwaway culture. My motto is "build once, build right"; if you build it right the first time, you don't need to keep on revisiting and rebuilding.

Crucially, this means #useThePlatform. When you build with native tools, rather than libraries, you build for the long term. You build to last.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [a front-end framework](https://github.com/andyjessop/pivot) that encourages long-lived, decoupled code for SPAs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m starting to write down thoughts, ideas, and experiences. You can find them on my DEV.to page [here](https://dev.to/andyjessop).
