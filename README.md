### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Andy, a dedicated technical lead with over 10 years of experience in software engineering, specialising in creating maintainable, accessible, testable, and performant web applications.

I _love_ quality, and _loathe_ the throwaway culture. I believe you should "build it once, build it right"; if you build it right the first time, you don't need to keep on revisiting and rebuilding.

Crucially, this means #useThePlatform. When you build with native tools, rather than libraries, you build for the long term. You build to last.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently learning Golang, and absolutely loving it.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m starting to write down thoughts, ideas, and experiences. You can find them on my DEV.to page [here](https://dev.to/andyjessop).
